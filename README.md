## Project CI/CD

This Project's CI/CD is made with Github Actions

## How to run this project

- You can either fork this project and run your Github Actions or create pull request to trigger actions here
- You can pull project and run it locally with command "mvn clean test", however you need to provide specific variables

### Test Args/Variables
- API_USER - user for api tests to authenticate. In CI/CD this variables needs to be set as secret in repository
- API_PASSWORD - password to authenticate to API to acquire token. In CI/CD this variables needs to be set as secret in repository
- isHEADLESS - to set UI tests in headless or no-headless mode

## How to get report from test runs

All the tests use Allure Framework as reporting tool. 

### Local report generation
In order to generate report with it, one must first download and setup allure commandline.
Information to how setup this commandline can be found on Allure's official documentation [here](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) 
in section **Installing a commandline** under *2.1.4. Manual installation*.

Once it is setup up, one does need to be in project directory and run command

```shell script
$ allure serve [results_location]
```
for example

```shell script
$ allure serve ui-task/target/allure-results
```

_All results are placed in target folder in each module_


### Report generation via Github Actions

Report is automatically generated and published to Github Pages. In order to use that flow in your fork
you need to do couple of things:

* Create gh-pages branch in your repo/fork
* Generate personal access token for your github repo (you can find how to do it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)).
Permissions should be set like described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token)
* Set newly generated token as Github Secret with name *"SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN"* (unless you change it in your fork)


After setting up the necessary things, run the tests and the newly generated report should be visible in "Deployments/Activity log" as new Github Pages deployment.
In order to view the report, one simply needs to click on the "View deployment" button.
